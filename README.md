# FdF-Wireframe

In completing this project, I learned about rotational matrices and bresenham's line drawing algorithm. I take input from a file that gives X,Y,Z input and project it with a library that only allows put_pixel(x,y).

To use:
1. Download the repository and run "make" in the terminal.
2. Run "./fdf test_maps/filename.fdf"
3. Use "I" to zoom in and "O" to zoom out.
3. Use "W, S, D, A" for rotation.
4. Use arrow keys for translation.
5. Use C for cool color effects.
